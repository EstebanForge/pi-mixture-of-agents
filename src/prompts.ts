/**
 * Aggregator prompts for pi-mixture-of-agents.
 *
 * Hermes uses TWO meaningfully different aggregator prompt strategies:
 *
 *  1. One-shot  (agent/moa_loop.py aggregate_moa_context) — the aggregator
 *     synthesizes refs into ADVISORY guidance for the main agent. It must NOT
 *     answer the user directly. The main agent loop then consumes that
 *     guidance and produces the real answer.
 *
 *  2. Session   (agent/moa_loop.py MoAChatCompletions.create) — the aggregator
 *     IS the acting model. It answers the user or calls tools directly, with
 *     the reference context appended as background.
 *
 * The block wrapper `[Mixture of Agents reference context]` is the same in
 * both; only the surrounding instruction differs.
